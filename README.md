# Remixing the Weather

The classic weather app built with the Remix framework. There will be a lot of Googling!

## To do

* Save the user's city choices
* Add a stylesheet
* Bring in the MUI framework
    * Sort fonts
    * Sort icons 
* Fetch weather data from somewhere somehow

## Notes 

This has a been quite a tricky development experience so far. At the moment, I'm thinking like a React developer, with all of my data-fetching happening on the client-side. Remix doesn't quite work like this.
